# Reassessing the Reliability of P-values in Goodness-of-Fit Tests
Simulation-based study evaluating the reliability of p-values in Goodness-of-Fit tests for actuarial models using Burr mixture and truncated lognormal distributions.


This repository contains the full research and simulation code for my Masterâ€™s thesis titled:

**"Reassessing the Goodness-of-Fit Tests in Actuarial Science Decision-Making: Can We Rely on P-value Reports?"**

The study critically examines the behavior of p-values under both null and alternative models to evaluate the performance of popular GoF tests in actuarial modeling.


## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objective

To assess whether traditional p-value reports from GoF tests can reliably guide model adequacy decisions in actuarial contexts â€” especially under heavy-tailed and complex distributions like the **Burr Mixture** and **left-truncated Lognormal**.


## ðŸ§ª Methodology

- **Distributions Tested**:  
  - Burr(Î±, Î¸, Î³) â€” fitted to Danish fire loss data  
  - Burr Mixture (2 components)  
  - Left-Truncated Lognormal distribution

- **GoF Tests Evaluated**:  
  - Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (KS)  
  - Andersonâ€“Darling (AD)  
  - CramÃ©râ€“von Mises (CvM)  
  - Chi-Square

- **Metrics Analyzed**:
  - Empirical Type I Error rates
  - Empirical Power
  - P-value histograms and distribution shapes under simulation

- **Sample Sizes Simulated**:  
  10, 100, 500, 1000, 2500

- **Simulation Count**:  
  2,000 iterations per scenario
  Different alpha levels used


## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- P-values under the null were often "**uniform**".
- GoF test power varied substantially with distribution parameters, alpha levels and sample sizes.
- The **AD and CvM tests** showed better sensitivity to tail differences than KS in Burr contexts.
- Using p-values alone without visual and structural model assessment may be **misleading** in actuarial settings.
